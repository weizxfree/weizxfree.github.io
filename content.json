I have witnessed an old colleague leading a team to work hard on a project for more than two years. After the project was launched, a key performance problem was found to be unresolved, which resulted in the customer being unable to integrate and use it. The team of dozens of people and more than two years of hard work were all wasted.This incident gave me a deep feeling. If it were me or you, in the chess game, how could we ensure that what we do achieves the goal as much as possible and reduce the possibility of failure? What is the Reverse Working Method The Reverse Working Method refers to building a strategy on unchanging things. It comes from Amazon founder Bezos. Whenever he has to make a major decision, he often thinks about the problem in this way. For example, Bezos believes that in the retail industry, what customers always want is lower prices, faster delivery and more choices. Companies must first figure out what customers want, and then reverse operations and invest a lot of energy in the right things. Only in this way can companies continue to gain blood in the future. Bezos’s reverse working methodWhen Bezos chose to start a business, his boss tried to persuade him to stay. He was not sure whether his business would be successful. Before he made the decision, he made a minimum regret table, “Suppose that when you are 80 years old, will you regret not starting a business when you were 20?” The answer is obvious. He will not regret not becoming a higher-level professional manager, but he will definitely regret not starting a business. Bezos later applied this logic to his personal life. Whenever he had to make a major decision, he would often think about the problem in this way. This is the “reverse working method”, the most important of which is to find the original purpose of doing this thing at the beginning, and then work according to this purpose. In sharp contrast, the “skill-oriented method” advocates “what we are good at”, “what else can we do by doing what we do?” Although in many cases, the skill-oriented method is a useful and effective business model to a certain extent. But if you immerse yourself in it, you will lose the motivation for innovation. Apple, led by Steve Jobs, often adopts the “skill-oriented approach”. Apple’s innovation is often the product of technological change and Steve Jobs’s wild imagination. Under this method, companies tend to lead customers, change consumption concepts, and let customers accept its products and ideas. Bezos believes that the overall philosophy of Amazon’s website design is customer-friendly and should focus on customers rather than websites. His goal is not only to make browsing books easier, but also to make it a pleasant experience. It is under this philosophy that Amazon invented the “one-click ordering” function to facilitate customer purchases; there are also “reading in the book” and “searching in the book” functions, which have won the love and pursuit of the majority of customers, especially college students. It is this attitude of considering customers that has won the favor of customers. Amazon’s book review area is more like a social platform, where people can speak freely. It is precisely because of the customer base and good reputation established in this way that Amazon’s book sales continue to increase. Start with the end in mindThe reverse working method is a good way of thinking. By reversing the key nodes or product strategies from the goal, the purpose of focusing can be achieved in the end.If you ask what is the most important point of the reverse working method? It must be the change of thinking habits:**The fundamental starting point of the “reverse working method” is to change from the internal or company perspective to the customer perspective. ** Press releaseThe reverse working method is easy to say, but it is difficult to implement. Because people’s thinking habits are naturally positive, and they rush forward based on their existing experience and thinking habits. There is one thing I want to share with you about Amazon’s reverse working method: Press release. Press release allows readers to have the most wonderful customer experience. Frequently Asked Questions provides all the important details about the customer experience, while fully and clearly assessing how much cost or challenges the company will face in building the product or creating the service. The press release mainly includes the following parts: Title: Point out the name of the product in a way that is easy for the reader (your target customer) to understand. Subtitle: Describe the product and the benefits of using the product for customers. Summary: First state the city, media channel and planned release date, and then briefly describe the product and its benefits. Problem: Describe the specific problem that the product is going to solve. Be sure to write this section from the customer’s perspective. Solution: Describe your product in some detail and how it conveniently solves the customer’s problem. Quote and Buy: Quote a company spokesperson and then a hypothetical customer to show the various benefits they get from using your new product. Make it easy and quick to buy the product, and provide a website link so that customers can get more information and buy the product. FAQs are usually divided into External FAQs (focused on customers) and Internal FAQs (focused on the company). External FAQs are questions that customers or the media will ask about the product, including more detailed questions such as how the product works, how much it costs, how and where to buy it, etc. These questions are specific to the product, so each PR&#x2F;FAQ **FAQ is unique. Internal FAQs have a more standardized list of questions that need to be answered. In fact, this is the idea of ​​”starting with the end in mind”, and we can introduce “Press Releases” and “FAQs” at the same time. KindleAs a household e-book reader, the decision-making process of this product is very worth learning. The two major innovations of Kindle are wireless transmission and electronic ink screen. As a product that has never been seen on the market, these innovations use the reverse working method when making decisions. Only wireless transmission can put the library in your pocket, instead of considering how to achieve the technology first; only electronic ink screen can achieve a reading experience close to paper books. Starting from customer needs, the core competitive points of the product are deduced backwards. This is a typical application scenario. SummaryThe reverse working method is essentially a change in thinking mode, from the company’s internal transformation to the market customer, and the strategic setting is based on the “unchanging” basic points, and the execution is reversed.","categories":[],"tags":[]},{"title":"Tracking","slug":"data-track","date":"2024-09-24T03:41:27.383Z","updated":"2024-09-24T10:03:54.802Z","comments":true,"path":"en/data-track/","permalink":"https://www.datatower.site/en/data-track/","excerpt":"","text":"In the field of big data, there are many ways to get data sources, such as servers, data warehouses, and clients. Clients include Android, iOS, web pages, applets, and third-party frameworks or platforms such as Flutter, React Native, and uni-app. For client applications and web pages, tracking is an indispensable part of the big data analysis system. What is tracking?Since 2010, a number of big data service providers focusing on user behavior analysis and automated operations have emerged in China, such as Sensors Data, GrowingIO, Analysys, and Volcano Engine. In the process of providing services to multiple industries such as banking, securities, retail, and enterprises, we realized a basic and key point: the importance of data foundation. Common questions include: *Why is my data lost? Why is there a huge difference in the amount of data on different platforms? * These problems often occur. These problems all prove that data quality is crucial to the entire system. Importance of data qualityIf there is a problem with data quality, subsequent analysis and operation are almost impossible to talk about. Even if a seemingly perfect report and conclusion are generated, the authenticity behind it is still questionable. Common tracking point types1. Code tracking pointCode tracking point, as the name suggests, is a way to report data through code. Its advantage is high flexibility, which can collect more targeted data according to business needs and improve the accuracy of data analysis. But its disadvantages are also obvious: code tracking points need to be released with the App version to take effect, the cycle is long, and the development cost is high. Over time, the rolling increase in tracking points may lead to a decrease in quality and efficiency. 2. Visual tracking pointVisual tracking point, that is, through intuitive interface operation, users can easily complete the tracking point operation by clicking, selecting, etc. This method lowers the technical threshold, so that people without development background can also complete the tracking work independently. Although this method improves convenience, it also has the problem of tracking point fragmentation, especially when the App or web page is frequently updated. For example, the tracking point set today is effective, but it may become invalid in a few months. In addition, different platforms (such as Android, iOS, and Web) still need to be configured separately, which increases the workload. Visual tracking and code tracking complement each other and are suitable for different business scenarios. For example, on the H5 activity page embedded in the App, operators can easily meet the needs through visual tracking. 3. No trackingNo tracking, also known as full tracking, is to automatically collect user behavior data such as page browsing, staying, clicking, leaving, and other user operation information by integrating SDK. The biggest advantage of this method is that it significantly reduces development costs and facilitates the rapid collection of basic user behavior data. However, the limitation of no tracking is that it can only collect standard user interaction data and cannot capture specific business information. For example, detailed data such as which product the user purchased and the price of the product cannot be automatically obtained. 4. Tag ManagerTag Manager (Tag Manager) is more popular abroad, and the typical representative is Google Tag Manager. It is not only used for tracking, but also can be used to manage various tracking codes on websites or apps. Tag Manager combines the advantages of code tracking and visual tracking, and is particularly suitable for Web scenarios. Due to the flexibility of JavaScript, Tag Manager can dynamically issue codes according to the set rules, avoiding the problem of re-publishing every time the code is updated, and tracking can also take effect in real time. However, for mobile terminals, its application scenarios are relatively limited. In the future, tools similar to Google Tag Manager may also be born in China. SummaryNo matter which tracking method is used, it needs to be selected in combination with the actual business scenario. If it is business-oriented information, server-side tracking is more appropriate; while information that is more inclined to application interaction is suitable for tracking on the client. For teams with limited development resources, you can choose no tracking or visual tracking; if you pursue comprehensiveness and flexibility of data, code tracking is the best choice. Ultimately, the core of tracking is to serve business indicators, rather than to pursue all-round coverage. The right one is the best.","categories":[],"tags":[]},{"title":"亚马逊逆向工作法","slug":"method_begin_end","date":"2024-09-24T02:40:52.384Z","updated":"2024-09-24T09:17:52.665Z","comments":true,"path":"zh-CN/method_begin_end/","permalink":"https://www.datatower.site/zh-CN/method_begin_end/","excerpt":"","text":"职场工作十年有余，见证了老同事带领团队辛辛苦苦做了一个项目两年多，项目上线后，发现一个关键的性能问题未解决，导致客户无法集成使用，几十人的团队，两年多的付出都付诸东流。这件事给我深刻的感触，如果是我或者你，身处棋局，如何尽可能保证我们做出来的事情达成目标，降低失败的可能性？ 什么是逆向工作法 逆向工作法指的是把战略建立在不变的事物上。来源于亚马逊创始人贝佐斯，每当他不得不做出重大决策时，他常常会以这种方式来思考问题，比如贝佐斯认为在零售业，客户永远不变的就是想要更低的价格、更快捷的配送和更多样的选择,企业必须先搞清楚客户究竟要什么，再进行逆向操作，在对的事情上投入大量精力，只有这样企业才能在未来持续获血。 贝佐斯的逆向工作法贝佐斯在选择创业时，老板多方挽留。他也不确定自己创业是否能成功，在他作出决定之前，他做了一个最小化后悔表,“假设自己80岁高龄时,对20岁时没有创业会不会后悔?” 答案是显而易见的，他不会因为自己没有成为更高阶的职业经理人而后悔，但是如果没有创业他一定会后悔。贝佐斯后来还将这种逻辑应用到他的个人生活中，每当他不得不做出重大决策时，他常常会以这种方式来思考问题。 这就是“逆向工作法”，其最关键的就是找到你一开始做这件事情的最初目的，然后根据这个目的去工作。 而与之形成鲜明对比的“技能导向法”则主张“我们擅长做什么”、“ 通过做什么，还能再做什么?”尽管不少时候，技能导向法是一种有用并且一定程度上奏效的商业模式。但如果沉浸于此，就会丧失创新的动力。 乔布斯领导的苹果公司采取的常常是“技能导向法”，苹果公司的创新往往是技术的变革以及乔布斯天马行空的想象力结合的产物。在这个方法下，企业更倾向于领导客户，改变消费观念，让顾客接受它的产品和理念。 而贝佐斯认为，亚马逊网站设计的总体哲学是对客户友好，应该将注意力放在顾客身上，而不是网站上。他的目标不仅是让浏览书籍变得更容易，而且要让这成为-种愉快的体验。正是在这种哲学之下，亚马逊发明了“一键下单”功能以方便顾客购买;还有“书内阅读”、“书内搜索”功能，获得了广大顾客尤其是大学生群体的喜爱和追捧。 正是这种为顾客着想的态度赢得了顾客的好感，亚马逊的书评区更像-一个社交平台, 人们在这里畅所欲言，也正因为通过这种方式建立起来的顾客群体和良好口碑，亚马逊的图书销量不断提升。 以终为始逆向工作法是一个很好的思维方式。通过以目标倒推关键节点或产品策略，最终达成聚焦的目的。如果要问逆向工作法最重要的一点是什么？一定是思维习惯的转变：“逆向工作法” 的根本出发点，是从内部或公司的视角转变为客户的视角。 新闻稿逆向工作法说起来简单，实施起来却很难。因为人的思维习惯天然的从正向思考，根据已有的经验和思维习惯惯性的往前冲。亚马逊的逆向工作法中有一点我想和大家分享下：新闻稿。 新闻稿让读者拥有最精彩的客户体验。常见问题提供关于客户体验的所有重要细节，同时又能全面而清晰地评估公司打造该产品或创造该服务将面临多大的成本或挑战。 新闻稿主要包括下列部分： 标题：以阅读者（你的目标客户）容易理解的方式点出产品的名字。 副标题：描述产品以及客户使用该产品的益处。 摘要：首先写明城市、媒体渠道以及计划发布的日期，然后简述产品的情况及其好处。 问题：描述产品要解决的具体问题。一定要从客户的角度写这个部分。 解决方案：较为详细地描述你的产品，以及它如何便捷地解决客户的问题。 引用及购买：引用公司发言人的一句话，再引用假想客户的一句话，表明他们使用你的新产品所获得的各种好处。要表明购买该产品方便、快捷，给出网站链接，以便让客户获取更多信息和购买产品。 常见问题通常可分为对外常见问题（关注客户）和对内常见问题（关注公司）。对外常见问题是客户或媒体会对有关产品提出的问题，包括产品的工作方式、价格、如何及何处购买等更为细节的问题。这些问题是针对具体产品的，因而每份 PR&#x2F;FAQ 的常见问题都是独特的。对内常见问题则有更标准化的、需要予以解答的问题清单。 其实这里就是 “以终为始” 的思想，我们可以同时引入 “新闻稿” 和 “常见问题”。 KindleKindle 作为家喻户晓的电子书阅读器，这个产品的决策过程是非常值得学习的。Kindle的两大创新在于无线传送和电子墨水屏。作为一个市面上从未见过的产品，这些创新点在决策时运用了逆向工作法，只有无线传送，才可以把图书馆装到自己的口袋，而不是先考虑技术如何实现；只有电子墨水屏，才能实现接近纸质书的阅读体验。从客户的需求出发，倒推出产品的核心竞争点。这是典型的应用场景。 总结逆向工作法本质上是思维方式的改变，由公司内部转变成市场客户，把战略的设定基于「不变的」的基本点，倒推执行。","categories":[],"tags":[]},{"title":"埋点","slug":"data-track","date":"2024-09-24T02:40:52.380Z","updated":"2024-09-24T10:03:28.192Z","comments":true,"path":"zh-CN/data-track/","permalink":"https://www.datatower.site/zh-CN/data-track/","excerpt":"","text":"在大数据领域，数据源有多种途径，如服务端、数据仓库、客户端等。客户端包含 Android、iOS、网页、小程序，以及 Flutter、React Native、uni-app 等第三方框架或平台。对于客户端应用和网页而言，埋点是大数据分析系统中不可或缺的组成部分。 什么是埋点？自 2010 年起，国内涌现出一批专注于用户行为分析和自动化运营的大数据服务商，如神策数据、GrowingIO、易观、火山引擎等。在为银行、证券、零售、企业等多个行业提供服务的过程中，我们意识到一个基础且关键的点：数据根基的重要性。 常见的问题有：为什么我的数据丢失了？为什么不同平台的数据量存在巨大差异？ 这些问题时常发生。这些问题都印证了一点：数据质量对整个系统至关重要。 数据质量的重要性如果数据质量出现问题，后续的分析和运营几乎无从谈起。即使生成了一份看似完美的报表和结论，其背后的真实性依然存疑。 常见的埋点类型1. 代码埋点代码埋点，顾名思义，就是通过代码实现数据上报的方式。它的优点是灵活性高，可以根据业务需求采集更具针对性的数据，提升数据分析的精确度。 但它的缺点同样明显：代码埋点需要随 App 版本发布才能生效，周期较长，开发成本较高。随着时间推移，滚动增加的埋点可能导致质量和效率的下降。 2. 可视化埋点可视化埋点，即通过直观的界面操作，用户可以通过点击、选择等方式轻松完成埋点操作。这种方式降低了技术门槛，使得没有开发背景的人员也能独立完成埋点工作。 这种方式虽然提高了便捷性，但也存在埋点碎片化的问题，尤其是在 App 或网页频繁更新时。比如，今天设置的埋点有效，可能几个月后就失效了。此外，不同平台（如 Android、iOS、Web）仍需分别配置，增加了工作量。 可视化埋点和代码埋点相辅相成，适用于不同的业务场景。例如，在 App 内嵌的 H5 活动页面上，运营人员可以通过可视化埋点轻松满足需求。 3. 无埋点无埋点，也被称为全埋点，是通过集成 SDK 的方式，自动采集用户行为数据，如页面浏览、停留、点击、离开等用户操作信息。这种方式的最大优势是显著降低了开发成本，便于快速采集基础的用户行为数据。 然而，无埋点的局限性在于只能采集标准的用户交互数据，无法捕捉具体的业务信息。例如，用户购买了哪件商品、商品的价格等细节数据是无法自动获取的。 4. Tag ManagerTag Manager（标签管理器）在国外较为流行，典型代表是 Google Tag Manager。它不仅仅用于埋点，还可用于管理网站或 App 上的各种追踪代码。 Tag Manager 结合了代码埋点和可视化埋点的优点，尤其适合 Web 场景。由于 JavaScript 的灵活性，Tag Manager 可以根据设定的规则动态下发代码，避免了每次更新代码都需重新发布的问题，埋点也能实时生效。然而，对于移动端，它的应用场景则相对有限。 未来，国内或许也会诞生类似 Google Tag Manager 的工具。 总结无论采用哪种埋点方式，都需要结合实际的业务场景进行选择。如果是偏业务类的信息，服务端埋点更为合适；而偏向应用交互的信息，则适合在客户端埋点。对于开发资源紧张的团队，可以选择无埋点或可视化埋点；若追求数据的全面性和灵活性，则代码埋点是不二之选。 归根结底，埋点的核心是围绕业务指标服务，而不是追求面面俱到。合适的才是最好的。","categories":[],"tags":[]}],"categories":[],"tags":[]}
